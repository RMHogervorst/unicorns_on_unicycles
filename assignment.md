## assignment

This dataset is thought to have been recorded by
an amateur scientist, a natural philosopher by the name of Rudolphus
in the 17th century in The Netherlands. This scientist
recorded the annual population of unicorns in western Europe over a century and also recorded
the sales of unicycles in that same time period. Although not much of the
accompanying text remains of
the original documents, what we can read is the tables and the idea that
Rudolphus thought there was some sort of relationship between uncorns and
unicycle sales.

The documents were recently unearthed from a hidden chest in Delft
and seem to be written by Rudolphus Hogervorstus, my great great great uncle, in 1681. These documents show that he was studying the then roaming herds of unicorns
in the area around Delft. Unfortunately these animals are extinct now. 

His work contains multiple tables, carefully written down, documenting the population
of unicorns over time in multiple places and related to that the sales and numbers of
unicycles in those countries. 

There are also some text describing the hypotheses of Rudolphus, but
most of the texts were eaten by moths and have decayed over time.
Some of the remaining text suggest that, according to Rudolphus, the unicorn populations and unicycles were related:
"The presence of the cone on the unicorn hints at a very
defined sense of equilibrium, ...[some missing text].....  
it is therefore only natural to assume unicorns
ride unicycles". 

### Your task

We want to discover the relationship between unicorns and unicycles. 
As part of the archival process these tables were copied in excel.

Try to read the data in, if you are using R, try the package readxl.
It also helps if you look at the data before reading it in.

Load the two files, try to join them together. 

Is there a relation between unicorns and unicycles?
